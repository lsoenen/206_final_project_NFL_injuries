This is a program that aggregates NFL concussion data from the Sportradar API ( https://www.sportradar.com/choose_region/ ). It  allows users to view injury concussion information based on specific positions and seasons. This information can be displayed using a plotly bar chart or pie chart. The API I used is a web API I have not used before that requires an API key. In order to incorporate them into my program I used a secrets.py file format.
