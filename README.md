In order to access this data source you must register for an account or sign up for a free trial where you will be eligible to receive your API key. Once you receive your key you will need to create a secrets.py file which will contain your key.

Also, in order to run the program and see the plotly graphs you will need to make an account on https://plot.ly/.

Two of my most important functions produce visuals that allow users to see graphs which the average amount of total injuries for a specific position by season and the total number of concussions in the oldest season compared to the total number of concussions in the most recent season. This data is first put into two large lists which is then inserted into an NFL database.  

In order to run the program simply select an NFL season between 2010 and 2017 and then choose which visualization option you would like to see. Options below:

1. The total number of injuries in 2012
2. The Percentage of concussions in 2012
3. The total number of injuries by position in 2012
4. The total number of concussions in 2012 compared to 2009

Whichever number you input will produce a bar chart or pie chart for that given season. If you wish to return to selecting a season, type 'exit' in the command line. If you then wish to end the program type 'exit' again.
